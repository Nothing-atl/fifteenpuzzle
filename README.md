This project aims to develop a solver for the NxN puzzle using a variety of algorithms, heuristics, and techniques. The solver will be programmed in Java and optimized for solving the puzzle in the least possible moves. The project involves testing the solver on various NxN puzzle configurations, ranging from 3x3 to 9x9. During the process I have tried many algorithms and heuristics to develop this solver. The project will contribute to the development of more efficient and effective solvers for the NxN puzzle, which has implications for various industries, including gaming, logistics, and transportation.
